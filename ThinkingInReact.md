**#Thinking In React**
What is react? It is the view in the MVC structure. It allows you to create your own html components and customize functionality of that component. Most text define it as "... a framework that is a JavaScript library used to craft modern day UI and views for the front-end in web applications."

#### Steps Help you start:
1. *Start with a mock & Break it into components* Draw boxes around each component of the app so you know how the build breaks down (ex. App, Board,Square etc)
1. *Build a static version of the App in React* This should have no interconnectivity but should render the user interface as you want it to appear. The components will only have render() methods at this point.  The goal is to have a library of reusable components that you can use 
1. *Id the minimal but complete representation of the User Interface state. 
1. Id where your state should live 
1. Add inverse Data flow









####Terms and Concepts
*One-way data flow
